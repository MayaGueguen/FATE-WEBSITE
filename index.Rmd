## [About FATE-HD](https://mayagueguen.github.io/FATE-WEBSITE/publications.html) <img src="pictures/link.png" alt="Link to" style="width:20px;height:20px;">

*"`FATE-HD` is a dynamic landscape vegetation model that simulates interactions between plant modelling entities (e.g. species or plant functional groups), their population dynamics and dispersal, whilst taking into account external drivers such as disturbance regimes, and environmental variations. The model is built on past conceptual and technical developments (Albert et al., 2008; Midgley et al., 2010) but has been entirely recoded in C++ and revisited."* ([Boulangeat, 2014](http://www.will.chez-alice.fr/pdf/BoulangeatGCB2014.pdf "Boulangeat, I., Georges, D., Thuiller, W., FATE-HD: A spatially and temporally explicit integrated model for predicting vegetation structure and diversity at regional scale. Global Change Biology, 20, 2368â€“2378."))

Available publications retrace the "history" of the software, from past conceptual and technical developments (Midgley et al., 2010), improvements of softwares and theoretical framework (Boulangeat 2013, 2014) and applications.

## [Source code]()

<br/>

### [`FATE-HD` on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/biomove/) <img src="pictures/link.png" alt="Link to" style="width:20px;height:20px;">

Two versions are available online :

- a **STABLE** one : this is the one that can be downloaded if by-hand-installation is required.
- a **DEVEL** (development) one : we do not advise to use this one as it might be subject to bugs or missing elements.

<br/>

### [`RFate` package](https://mayagueguen.github.io/RFate/) <img src="pictures/link.png" alt="Link to" style="width:20px;height:20px;">

`RFate` is a `R` package designed to help the user in using the software `FATE-HD`. It provides functions **PRE** and **POST** simulations :

- PRE simulations : 
    - to build Plant Functional Groups with dominant species
    - to prepare parameter files
- POST simulations :
    - to produce graphics
    - to analyze results
    - etc
