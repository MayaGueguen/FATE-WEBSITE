## Global view

### Conceptual diagram of `FATE-HD`

The whole area is divided in grid-cells in which an independent **succession model A)** regulates the PFG life cycle. 
PFG abundances are structured by age into cohorts and each cohort is attributed to a height stratum according to the growth parameters.

Four submodels affect this cycle at various levels :

**B) Shading** regulates interactions between cohorts affecting germination, recruitment and survival.

**C) Habitat suitability** affects the recruitment and fecundity rates.

**D) The seed dispersal model** makes `FATE-HD` spatially explicit by connecting grid-cells.  
It depends on the amount of seeds produced by mature plants and affects each PFG’s seed bank in each cell.

**E) Disturbances** affect PFG survival and fecundity.

### Life cycle of each PFG within `FATE-HD` and influences from sub-models

Only three age classes are considered : germinant, juvenile and mature.

The **recruitment** is influenced by the habitat suitability and the biotic interactions.

**Mortality** occurs when light conditions are not favorable or when the PFG completes its life span.

In addition, the disturbance regime directly affects juvenile or mature PFG and may for instance result in PFG death, impede **seed production** by reducing mature PFG age to N-1, or **revitalize senescents** by reducing their age to M-1.

## Source code

<br/>

### Class diagram

A `FATE-HD` simulation is based on a map whose pixels each contain a succession model (`SuFate`). This model can depend or not on habitat suitability (`SuFateH`).

All the pixels are linked together by the dispersal model (`Disp`).

Input parameters are given to the software via the simulation parameter file (`FilesOfParameters`) which contain global (`GlobalSimulParameters`) and PFG related parameters as well as maps. All of these informations are read and included into the model using templates for parameters (`Params`), constants (`FGutils`) and rasters (`Spatial`).
